NOTES:

light is affected by blackholes. not visa versa. in our total simulations 
we should be working on the black holes before the rays in each and every step

for rays, ALWAYS make sure you reset the pdir from polar to cartesian before you set bh_in_range= NULL. 
If we end up with no blackhole to say we excaped from we don't have anything to convert the circular coords
